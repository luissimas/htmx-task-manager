#+title:Task manager

This project is a simple task list app made as a study case of Go + HTMX + Tailwind CSS.

The idea is to provide:

- Server-side rendering using Go's builtin [[https://pkg.go.dev/html/template][html/template]] package
- Interactivity/SPA feel using [[https://htmx.org/][HTMX]] + a bit of custom JavaScript
- Styling done via [[https://tailwindcss.com/][Tailwind CSS]] and [[https://daisyui.com/][DaisyUI]]
- Toggle dark/light theme (the choice is persisted in [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage][localStorage]])
- A default not found page (try going to [[http://localhost:3000/any-random-uri-that-does-not-really-exist]])
** Getting started
Install the tailwind dependencies:

#+begin_src shell
npm i
#+end_src

Compile the CSS:

#+begin_src shell
make css
#+end_src

Install the Go server dependencies:

#+begin_src shell
go mod tidy
#+end_src

Run the Go web server:

#+begin_src shell
make run
#+end_src

Access the app at [[http://localhost:3000/]].
